# ML_Project

Overview:
Created a Machine Learning model to predict whether the given link for any website is a phishing website or not.

Tech Stacks:
Language: Python

Frameworks: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

Dataset:

Source: Kaggle

The dataset comprised of 89 features with a total of 11,429 records where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing

Results:

Used four Machine Learning algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regession, Radom Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Random Forest algorithm had the highest accuracy of 96.89% as it uses the ensemble learning method that combines multiple algorithms into a single algorithm to predict the outcomes.
